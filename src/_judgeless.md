# Journeys of Judged Pursuits

Some skills have built-in judges others don't.
For example, weightlifting has a built-in judge because you are judged by the amount of weight you lift, not some external source.
Singing on the other hand does not have a built-in judge, and in fact every person who listens is a judge.
Two people hearing the same music can have different opinions about the quality, but two people seeing a weightlifter will have no dispute over the mass of the objects being lifted.

## How to spot the difference

Skills exist on a spectrum from judgeless to fully judged.
On the far judgeless side there is track, where the winners win because the timer showed a smaller number than their opponents when they crossed the finish line.
Most sports are on this side of the spectrum because you are playing against an opponent who serves as the judge.
You score more than the opponent and you win - simple and easy.
Sports like diving and gymnastics have judges so the skill is more creative but the scoring is pretty standardized.
Moving across the spectrum to judged skills things generally become more artistic.
Dancing and painting both have aspects that can be practiced in judgeless ways but the choreography and composition are the hard part.
Creating something new requires judges in a way.
Things like creative writing, which are a pure expression of thought are on the fully judged side of the spectrum.
As a general rule the more physical an act is the more judgeless it is and the more brainy it is the more judge-ish.
There are outlier of course like speed math which is fully judged but non-physical and Jiu Jitsu which is physical but closer to the art form of chess than weightlifting.

## The outliers

There are a few things that come to mind when trying to find skills that are both fully judged but easy to get feedback on.
By fully judged I mean creative.

## Things that are judged because of beauty vs things that are creative because there are too many possibilities to practice

## It is easier to improve in judgeless tasks

## Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

## Creativity requires skills that have external judges

## How to practice skills with external judges

We can't practice as easily if the skill we are working on has external judges.
For me this is especially true in writing.
As a fairly new writer, I can write something that makes perfect sense in my head and that I think is the best thing ever written, but in reality is a bland confusing mess to others.
It is overwhelming and unhealthy to put out creative things on the internet because you will get skewed feedback and feedback that is inconsistent.
Some will say they love it some will hate it.
Publishing things is the ultimate decider of quality - or at least market viability which is a fair enough proxy.
When you publish something focus not on the feedback that people give you intentionally, focus on the feedback they do implicitly.
This gives way to the entire field of data analytics.
Look at how many people view it and for how long.
Look at which things get more viewers than others.

Next, have people whose opinion you can trust and ask them.
This is much better than putting something on the internet and getting feedback.
The feedback will be faster and more intimate because you can explain your thought process and your trusted reviewer can explain where you went wrong.

Lastly, consume the great works in your field.
Because there is no judge built into the skill, the judge is human nature of the people who will be consuming.
Understand the field's history and what worked in the past and why it worked.
Understand where the field is going and how you can push it forward.
Reading the books that are considered great will give you a deeper understanding of why they are considered great.
I'm unsure if it is possible to become great at something creative without consuming and understanding the greatness that came before.

## What are judged pursuits

Anything we attempt to be good at lies along a spectrum from internally judged to externally judged.
On the internally judged side exist things that can be practiced and judged in total isolation, like weightlifting.
You either lift the weight or you don't.
Same with running where the judge is a clock.
