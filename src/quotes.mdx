Sometimes in life, it helps to have a few poems and quotes memorized.
Something about them cuts past the fluff of language in a way that makes the truth easier to find. 

Once you have them memorized, you'll be suprised by just how often you use them as little mental hooks to guide you in the right direction.

Here are the quotes and poems that I have found most useful.

> How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.

Annie Dillard

> This is why we're here.

Some poet I heard speak back in college.

This was part of a long poem about the challenges we face in life.
We must remind ourselves that all the negative emotions we will feel are important and what make life beautiful.
When you are struggling and hurt and broken, remember that this is the human experience; this is why we're here.

> War is and ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things.

> Out of the night that covers me,  
> Black as the pit from pole to pole,  
> I thank whatever gods may be  
> For my unconquerable soul.

> In the fell clutch of circumstance  
> I have not winced nor cried aloud.   
> Under the bludgeonings of chance  
> My head is bloody, but unbowed.  
>
> Beyond this place of wrath and tears  
> Looms but the Horor of the shade,  
> And yet the menace of the years  
> Finds and shall find me unafraid.  
> 
> It matters not how strait the gate,  
> How charged with punishments the scroll,  
> I am the master of my fate,  
> I am the captian of my soul.  

Invictus by William Earnest Henely

Ancient wisdom

When things are good, remember that it won't last forever.
When things are bad, remember that it won't last forever.
