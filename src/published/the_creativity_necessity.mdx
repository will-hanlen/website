description: Even though we can go through modern life buying everything we need to survive, building things is still a core part of what makes us human. Life is better when we create.

Creativity is no longer necessary for survival.
We live in a world where we can get everything we need delivered to our doors for almost no money.
That is an amazing things, but I believe this environment often detaches us from our humanity and limits our personal growth.
We overcome this by consistently creating valuable things and sharing them with others.

The act of *consistent creation connects us to being human, teaches us about ourselves, gives us valuable skills, and ultimately provides a path towards personal meaning.*
It is necessary for a fulfilling life.

## Benefits of Creativity

**Being creative makes us human:**
Humans evolved as creative problem solvers.
We feel good when we create because creativity helped our ancestors survive.
Though we don't need creativity to physically survive in a world with grocery stores and Amazon, we need it to connect to our heritage as humans.

**Creativity connects us to others:**
Sharing the fruits of our labor is the ultimate satisfaction.
All humans want to feel valuable, and a straight-forward way to do that is to create valuable things for others.
When we make valuable things and share them, we grow closer to a community and become valuable to it.

**Consistent creativity teaches you how to live:**
Some skills like discipline and focus are necessary for living a fulfilling life.
Being creative requires these skills.

Making something of value is hard work and if you are consistent in your creative efforts you will learn to control your mind and actions - a skill that is valuable in all aspects of life.

**Creativity teaches you about yourself:**
Nobody is born knowing their passions, and you don't find it by consuming what others have done.
Being truly passionate about something requires hours of work where failures are inevitable but necessary for growth.
The more you try the more you will understand yourself.
*Passions are not found, they are built.*

## Getting the most out of creativity

Not all creations are useful.
Your 10th grade book report on a book you didn't read probably didn't help you find your life's meaning.
Neither did the half-finished painting in your closet or the premade freezer meals you made for dinner.

1. Deliberately choose where to be creative:

    Not every aspect of your life needs to be overflowing with inspiration and creativity.
    Sometimes the easy freezer meal is better than crafting a gourmet feast because it lets you focus on being creative in the places that matter to you.
    Try a bunch of creative things out, then narrow down to a few areas where you want to be creative and focus on being great in those.

1. Process over results:

    Your 10th grade book report didn't benefit you because you only cared about the grade, not the learning.
    Real growth comes from the process, not the result.
    If you fail miserably but worked hard in the process, you still get better.
    The opposite is not true.

1. Learn the fundamentals first:

    Great chefs possess a fundamental understanding of cooking tools and methods - not just the ability to read a recipe.
    The more fundamental you get with your learning, the more intimately you will understand and the faster you will learn.
    It might take more time upfront, but the long-term benefits will far surpass the quick solutions.
    Constrain yourself to start with the most fundamental tools and processes you can find.

1. Create with others:

    Collaborating makes us better and makes the process more fun.
    We learn quicker around others, we feel connected to a community of like-minded people, and we are kept accountable for progress and quality.

1. ** Be consistent:**

    To get the benefits of creativity you have to strain and improve every day.
    Just like how going to the gym every once in a while doesn't get you ripped, being creative only when it's convenient doesn't make you better.
    Do it every day.
