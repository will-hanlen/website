# Just use Vim dummy

If you know what Vim is already, stop reading this and just go learn it.
You know you should.
It will make you faster at editing any document and it could just save your poor hands from RSI.

## What is this things

Vim is an oldschool document editing program written in the 80s.
The main benefit of Vim is to do all of your editing without ever having to move you hands from the home row positions on your keyboard.
This makes you much faster because you don't have to go back and forth to your mouse or arrow keys.
There are a ton of expert level features in Vim like macros and sorting and all that, but the core of Vim that you will use 95% of the time isn't too complicated.
There are a million and one online tutorials on Vim, find one that you like and learn it.

## But it's so old

Yes, Vim is an old program, there are a lot of clunky parts, and it runs in a scary terminal, but none of that matters if you don't want it to.
Every modern editor has Vim plugins that will do everything you need, especially as a beginner.
I'm currently writing this markdown file in VSCode using a Vim plugin - and it's great.
I get all the benefits of a modern editor with pretty color schemes and integrated terminals without needing to write a complicated config file.
However, if you are up to the challenge I do recommend learning the real Vim initially instead of a plugin because you will have access to the built in vimtutor and all of the features that might not be in obvious places in a plugin.
If you are scared of terminals, NeoVim is pretty cool.

## Just do it

It will be hard at first, and the adjustment period will suck and you will be slow, but once you get used to it, you will scoff at the lowlifes who still click things with their mouse.
It doesn't matter if you are a full time programmer or a writer or just someone who types a lot of things in documents, Vim will greatly increase your abilit to transform thoughts into results on a computer.
And that's kinda the whole point.
