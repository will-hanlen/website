Here I will outline some of the reasons I'm making this site and the systems that will govern it.

## Guiding principles

1. Write clearly. Comprehension is the highest priority.
2. Eat ass


## Specific rules

1. Avoid dashes to break up sentences

 These encourage run-on sentences. Keep it simple.

1. Avoid parenthetical thoughts
 
 Same as above.

1. Avoid passive voice
