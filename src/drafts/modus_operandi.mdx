title: Manifesto
description: "This site exits to make me a better thinker and codify my manual for living a fulfilling life."

This site is not just a casual blog that I post random thoughts to.
It has 2 clear purposes.

## 1. Become a better thinker

Clear writing is clear thinking.
If you can't explain an idea clearly, in a way that a 9th grader would understand, then you probably don't *actually* understand the idea.

I'm not yet a good writer or a clear thinker and I want to change that.

Teaching something is the best way to learn it.
The act of writing forces you to truly understand the things you are writing about.
Although I will publish my writing here for others to read, make no mistake: These essays are not for you the reader, they are for me.

I will not attempt to present unique ideas that I've come up.
Instead I plan to present clear, useful ideas I've stolen from others.

## 2. Codify a manual for living

Being a human is stupidly difficult.
Especially with the decline of religiosity and community in the world, we need a system of living that make it easier for us to be fulfilled.

All the essays published here will be organized such that, when viewed as a whole, they present my summary of life and how to live it.

I want this body of knowledge to be complete enough that I could give it my eventual kids and be confident that if taken to heart they will live happy, healthy lives.

Of course, I will never know everything there is to know about life, so this project will never complete.
I will always be learning and revising my theories of life.

This means that every essay is a working document that will change as I change. I plan to completely rewrite ideas years after originally publishing if that makes sense.

## Guiding Principles

1. Anonymous

    I have no interst in gaing status or money from this blog.
    Fame brings with it a depenance on the audience which I would like to avoid.
    
    The ideas here have nothing to do with me, and by adding my name to them I attach my ego and thus my self worth.

2. Free

    I do not want to be depenant on this audience for my income.
    You can enjoy everything for free. 
    The only thing I ask for is feedback if you think I'm wrong and accountability if I'm being lazy.

3. Consice

    Most blog posts can be sufficiently summed up in a tweet so I will begin each essay with a tweet length summary.

4. Transparent

    I will publish all my [drafts](/drafts) and be transparent about the editing process.
    I will admit when I was wrong and need to update an essay.
    I will be transparent about my writing process and organization.

    To get updated when I make changes to essays, write new drafts, and come across interesting ideas, subscribe to the [newsletter](/newsletter).
