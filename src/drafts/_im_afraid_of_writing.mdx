# I'm afraid of writing

Few people in my everyday life know that I publish my writing on this site.
Not my girlfriend, not my mother, not some of my best friends.
I won't tell them.
I tell myself that their feedback will be useless because they will just tell me what I want to hear.
In reality, I'm afraid they will give me good feedback.

For some reason, publishing on the internet under my real name is scary.
Luckily nobody will read this unless I send them the link.

I want feedback, but from strangers so that if the feedback is negative it doesn't hurt my ego.
Writing is scary, but that's why I'm doing it.

Eventually I will show this to my siblings and closer friends, but only after I have found a voice for myself.

I never realized how much courage failing takes.

I don't even want to be a writer, I just like writing because it helps me clarify my thoughts.

I don't care if I gain "success" from this, but I still fear failure, even though failure is what will make me better.
I can't get better unless I make mistakes and learn from them.

I'm young and have no authority over any of the topics I've written about so I don't know how to be confident in my writing without caveating every time.

Getting better at writing requires writing, getting feedback, revising, and then starting all over again.
You won't get better unless you make mistakes, but with writing those mistakes are public.
Failing in public takes courage.

There is no judge of writing you can invoke in the privacy of your room.
You can't practice writing in isolation.
You need feedback and most of the feedback will be negative.
There will be typos you should have caught, and weak ideas exposed, but publishing is the way to get better.

It's scary but I know it's true.

Thesis: Getting better at things with no built-in judges is scary because you have to publish to get feedback.
Failure is inevitable, and in fact necessary, for growth, but when that failure is public, it takes courage to improve.
