description: My thoughts on fashion as a form of self expression.

Personal appearance is an important social signal.
If someone wears a lot of name brands, that says something about their personality.
The amount of hair gel a dude uses tells you about him.
The amount of makeup a girl wears tells you about her.
The trendiness of an outfit tells you which social group someone is trying to fit into.

If another person can see you, whether you like it or not, you are telling them about you in subtle ways.
Even if you never think about fashion or put any effort into curating a look, you are signaling that to other people.
Your personal appearance is always sending messages.
Choosing which message you want to send is the point of fashion.

I wish that it was possible to opt out of the fashion game but it's not;
and if I'm forced to play, I might as well figure out how.

## Why care

If you choose to not put effort into you personal appearance then you are choosing to not care about how people percieve you.
Maybe that's admirable, but it probably makes your life harder.

People treat you differently based on how they percieve you, and they percieve you is partially based on how you look.

You can intentionally look a certain way and induce a certain perception of yourself.

This is not all about looking attractive or impressive.
Your clothes can dial up or down the amount of attention you get or how seriously people take you.
You can intentionally dress to be percieved as less attractive, or less quirky, or less flashy.

## A system

I want to be intentional about my look because I care about how people percieve me, but I don't want to be consumed by thinking about it.
Caring how people percieve me can easily be taken too far into obessing about my appearance.

So I've made a few guidelines to follow when chosing my wardrobe.
Future me, never has to think about fashion again because present me has done all the work.

I will share my guidelines to explain the benefits I've gotten from being intentional about my fashion.
Your body and goals will be different than mine so you may need different guidelines.


### Guideline 1: No logos, words, or bold patterns

I know I just told you that personal appears says a lot about a person, but I want the opposite to be true for me.
I want my appearance to say as little as possible.

It's impossible to have it say nothing, but I don't want people to feel like they know what kind of person I am based on what I'm wearing.
Maybe I'm just a judgemental person, but I feel like I can predict a lot of someone's personality if they wear expressive clothes.
Someone wearing a "Fuck the Patriarchy" shirt is not hiding their worldview.

When people express too much through their fashion, I see it as them *trying* to be percieved a certain way.
Someone wearing an all Nike outfit is not hiding thier attempt to be seen as cool.

Not only do I not want to be seen as posturing, I genuinely don't want to be posturing.
I want my appearance to tell you almost nothing about who I am or who I want to be;
My words and actions can do that.

### Guideline 2: Every top should match with every bottom

I generally try to own as few things as possible because I believe it gives me more freedom and fewer dependencies.
When I apply this to my wardrobe it means I want to own as few articles of clothes while still maintianing a somewhat passable amount of variety.

This has the two benefits of less decision fatigue and being able to bring almost all my clothes with me on vacation.

The way I've managed to do this is to own only plain black shirts for everyday clothes.
All my pants are khaki, jeans, or light chinos to match with the black shirts.
There are probably ways to fulfill this guideline without wearing only one color shirt, but this way works for me.

I break this rule when it comes to formal wear and workout clothes.
Everyone's gotta own a suit but being able to match your suit pants with a running shirt is dumb.

### Guideline 3: Mobility over Fit

I personally find clothes that restrict my movement to be less comforatble, especially with pants.
However, I think slim fitting clothes are more attractive on me, especially with pants.

I think tight pants are less comforatble.
Unfortunately, I also think tighter pants are more attractive on me.

So should I prioritize looking good or being comforatble?

Most of the time, comfort is more important as long as it isn't percieved as laziness.
Besides, clothing has diminishing returns on attractiveness.
You can certainly make youself less attractive by what you wear, but going to the gym more will make a much bigger difference on attractiveness than tighter pants will.

Again, I don't apply this rule to formal clothes like suits, which exist solely to present a specific attracitve look.
