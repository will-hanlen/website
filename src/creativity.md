The <br> Creativity <br> Necessity
===


In the 21st century consuption is the default state, and creativity is no longer necessary for survial. 
This environment detaches us from our humanity and limits our personal growth.
We overcome this by consistently creating valuable things and sharing them with others.

Creativity is cooking a delicious meal, working on a car, writing computer code, anything that forces you to solve problems.
The act of consistent *creation connects us to being human, teaches us about ourselves, gives us valuable skills*, and ultimately provides a path towards personal meaning.
It is necessary for a fulfilling life.

## 1st order benefits 

**Being creative makes us human:**
Humans evolved to be creative to solve problems. 
We feel good when we are creative, because creativity helped our ancestors survive.
Though we don't need creativity to survive in a world with grocery stores and Amazon, we need it to fulfill that deeply human itch.


**Creativity connects us to others:**
It feels doubly as good when we make things that provide value for others as well as ourselves.
All humans want to feel like a valuable contributor to their group.
When we make valuable things and share them, we grow closer to a community and fulfill that inner want.

## 2nd order benefits

**Consistent creativity teaches you how to live:**
Some skills like discipline and focus are absolutely necessary for living a fulfillinig life. 
Being creative requires these skills. 
Making something of value is hard work;
It takes dedication and commitment and lots of effort.
If you are consistent in your creative efforts you will learn to control your mind and actions - a skill that is valuable in all aspects of life.

**Creativity teaches you about yourself:**
Nobody is born knowing their passions, and you don't find it by exclusively consuming what others have done. 
You become great by finding your own path through experimentation. 
Failures are inevitable but necessary for growth.
The more you try the more you will understand yourself. 
Passions are not found, they are built.

## Getting the most out of creativity

Not all creations are useful.
You're 10th grade book report on a book you didn't read probably didn't help you find you life's meaning.
Neither did the half-finished painting in your closet or the premade freezer meals.

**Deliberately choose where to be creative:**
Not every aspect of you life needs to be overflowing with inspiration and creativity.
Sometimes the easy freazer meal is better than crafting a gormet feast beacsue it lets you focus on being creative in the places that matter to you.
Try a bunch of creative things out then narrow down to a few areas where you want to be creative and focus on being great in those.

**Process over results:**
Your 10th grade book report didn't benefit you because you only cared about was the grade, not the learning you were supposed to be doing.
The real growth comes from the process, not the result.
If you fail miserably but worked hard in the process you still get better.
The opposite is not true.

**Learn the fundamentals first:**
Being a great chef requires a fundamental understanding of cooking tools and methods - not knowing only how to read instructions from a recipe. 
The more fundamental you get with your learning, the more intimatley you will understand and the faster you will learn. 
It might take more time upfront, but the benefits over the long haul will far outweigh the quick solutions. 
Constrain yourself to start with the most fundamental tools and processes you can find.

**Create with others:**
Collaborating makes us better and makes the process more fun. 
We learn quicker around others, we feel connected to a community of like minded people, and we are kept accountable for progress and quality.

**Be consistent:**
To get the benefits of creativity you have to strain and improve every day. 
Just like how going to the gym every once in a while doesn't get you ripped, being creative only when it's convinient doesn't make you better. 
Do it every day.
