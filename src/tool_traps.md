# Tool Traps

Tools can be the most dangerous risk to productivity out there.

For programmers, it starts early.
Someone shows you Vim.
Once you get good at Vim you become a plaintext purist - gagging at the thought of doing anything in a WYSIWYG environment.
You're now learning to do your budget, meal planning, and image editing in plaintext.
You install Linux and a tiling window manager to get get away from the mouse-based nonsense regular people use.
You throw out your Python codebases and do everything in C and shell scripts.
You get a standing desk and two plants in white porcelain pots.
Now you need new lights to complete the room's Feng Shui.
Your mechanical keyboard with custom keycaps clicks loudly so that everyone knows you're a professional.
Emacs lurks just around the corner and starts whispering beautiful ELisp in your ear.
You throw away your iPhone and get a 2006 Lenovo ThinkPad, like all the real programmers.
Your toolkit would be complete if only your operating system could talk to God.

Welcome to tool hell.
You will never be productive again because instead of doing real work, you write config files to manipulate the program you think you will eventually do work in.
You might even publish your config files thinking you are creating something valuable - you're not.
Hours and hours are spent fantasizing about the perfect workflow instead of actually having a workflow.

It's a serious problem, and not just for programmers.
Tool traps exists everywhere.
Aspiring musicians obsess over finding the perfect guitar picks and microphone stands.
Would-be chefs spend more time researching knives, buying them, and sharpening them, than actually cooking with them.

We fall into this trap because tools are cool and often useful, but the truth is, **tools just aren't as important as we think they are.**
A 1000 line Emacs config file and a 40% mechanical keyboard may be the most efficient programming setup in the world, but it has little impact on your ability to write quality programs.
A high-end, hand-crafted guitar may produce the perfect sound, but has little to do with your ability to compose good music.
The camera on your smartphone is better and cheaper than every camera that existed in 1940 but that doesn't make your TikTok cinematography rival Casablanca's.

**It's easy to improve your tools but it's hard to improve your craft**, yet we often think when we upgrade our tools we are getting better at our craft.
This is a fallacy.
If you suck at painting, a better easel won't fix it.
Painting more will.

I think this trap is especially alluring to programmers because in the computer world, all the of the best tools are free.
Vim and Emacs are great examples of this.
You can spend hundreds of hours configuring a 20% efficiency increase - which will make you 20% more efficient at typing things, not 20% better at making the things you type do interesting things.
Tools and craft are separate.

Tools are useful and exist for a reason, but they can trap you into thinking that better tools leads to better results.
To get out of this trap you must separate your thinking about tools from thinking about craft - then devote way more energy to craft than to tools.
Improving your tools is still valuable, but ensure you care about your craft before caring about your tools.
