description: Before you go trying to get famous, consider that it will almost certainly be bad for you.

I'm a bit afraid of fame.
This essay is me attempting to show that pursuit of fame, in most circumstances is detremental.
You be the judge and decide if that's true or if I'm just showing my insecurities.


My little brother wants to be a youtuber.
All of his friends want to be youtubers.
Sometimes, if i'm honest with myself, i want to be a youtuber.
It may seem like this is a wierd thing to say but I bet if you watch any non-trivial amount of Youtube you also want to be a youtuber.
Of course you do.
We all watch hours of these videos and inevitably start to think... hey i could do that.

Learn a bit of video editing, some catchy thumbnails, and BAM you've quit your job and are traveling around Europe backpacking and skiing through the next big vlog series.
It makes sense that we want that.
We are human afterall.
We all deeply want to be recognized and valued by others.
What better way to do that than have thousands of people watch you everyday.
Being famous a desire deep in the back of all of our minds because it tickles all of our evolutionary buttons: status, wealth, and probably sex.

So what's the big deal?
What's so wrong with wanting to be famous?

There's a problem if you are the product:

Say you want to start a youtube channel.
You think it has potential to be big like Matt D'avela or someone like that.
You fantasize about the impact you will have on your audience and the person you would feel like if only you had a touch of fame.
Maybe your fantasy is as simple as walking into a coffee shop and getting recognized by a fan.
Maybe it's telling a cute first date that you got to quit your job and follow your dreams.
Maybe it's the feeling of going on tour and to perform while thousands of people scream *your* name.

All this becomes a problem when you, as a person, become the product - which in the modern internet fame realm.... is instantly.
Unless you are pioneering a creative field, there will be thousands of other youtube channels making the exact same videos as you.
Just look around at any vlog style youtubers - all the videos are the same.
Any ideas you present will simply be rehashing things tons of other people are saying.
The number one thing youtubers can do to be successful is to be authentic.
The only unique thing about you need in your videos is you - and that's the point.
You are the product.
People are consuming you.
People won't watch your videos because of what you do but because of who you are.

This is true for pretty much any kind of internet fame nowadays.
If you want to start a self-help podcast, chances are none of your thoughts will be original.
Literally everyone in the word can talk into a microphone and make a podcast.
There are thousands upon thousands of self-help podcasts all quoting the same aphorisms and philosophizing about the same ideas.
But that's ok because they don't need to be original, they just need to be unique.
People might find your podcast because of the topic but they stay episode after episode because of the personality.
They stay because you are the product.
Successful podcasts are successful because of an interesting or desirable person hosting.
It's no suprise that Joe Rogan has the biggest podcast - he's interesting and increibly enviable.

This isn't true for all kinds of internet content of course.
People don't read the news because of the personality of the writer.

But why is this dangerous?

1. If you are the product, and the product isn't popular, what does that mean about you

 The internet is great at making you compare yourself to other people.
 Instagram is the worst I can think of.

# Two ways to get famous

Some famous people are famous because they can do incredible things that lots of people want to see.
Take Micael Phelps for example.
Everyone knows who he is because of what he can do in the pool.

Other famouse people are famous because of who they are.
To beat a dead horse, take Kim Kardashian for example.
I'm sure she's a great marketer, but she isn't remarkable in any fundamental way.
People watch her because she is an interesting personality to watch.

I don't find it hard to understand that everyone respects professional athletes and accepts their fame as waranted but looks at the Kardashians as unrespectable.

But fundamentally we watch Kim Kardashian and Micael Phelps because we want to be them.
If you don't believe me, read some Rene Girard.
We all want to be famous. We all want to desired like how Micael Phelps or Kim is.

The difference is that Phelps is famous for doing something.

Kim is just famous.


Main points:

- Social media increases the trend of wanting to famous instead of wanting to do something.
- Being famous isn't necessarily bad, but it makes it more likely that you will be unhappy. 
- Fame requires the approval of other people. You are not in charge
-
