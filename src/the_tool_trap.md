# The Tool Trap

The quest to inproving productivity is a continuous path the insanity and ultimately hell.
Someone shows you Vim and markdown instead of a silly IDE.
Once you get good at Vim you will soon become a plaintext purist - someone who gags at the thought of doing anything in a WYSIWYG environment.
You now do your budget, meal planning, and image editing in plaintext.
You will install Linux and a minimalist tiling window manager.
You will throw out your Python codebases and do everything in C and shell scripts.
You get a standing desk.
Emacs lurks just around the corner and starts whipsering beautiful ELisp to you while you sleep.
You will start believing Richard Stallman, throw away your iPhone and get a FreeSoftware Libre Tattoo.
You get rid of all your material possessions except 3 completely black outfits, you new 2006 Lenovo Thinkpad, and a spoon.
You don't need money anymore so you quit your job and write an open source operating system that allows you to talk to God.

Welcome to the promise land.
There is no escape.
You will never be productive, because instead of doing real work, you write config files to manipulate the purist program you think you will eventually do work in.
You care more about optimizing code than writing it.
You care more about fantasizing processes and making ideal workflows than actually having workflows.

It's a serious trap, but unlike alcoholism, other people respect it.
Sometimes doing real work is scary.
And procrastination is a sneaky mutherfucker - tricking you into being productive, just on the wrong things.
You might even publish you config files to trick yourself into thinking you are creating something valuable.

You're not.

And the worst part is that all of these tools and ideas are super useful.
Emacs is by far the best editor in the world (especially when combined with a Vim emulator).
Free Software is better for everybody.
and writing in C is pretty good for most things.

It's just that tools aren't as important as we think they are.

In every proffession this trap exists.
Ametuer musicians obsess over the perfect guitar tuning and microphones - even though that stuff really only matters at the highest level.
Amatuer painters spend crazy money on paints and brushes just to find better ones and buy those.
Aspiring cooks will spend more time researching knives buying them and sharpening them than actually cooking with them.

Tools are cool.
Too cool.
But when you're trying to create something, thinking about your tools too much is a trap.
