* Antilibrary

An [[https://fs.blog/2013/06/the-antilibrary/][antilibrary]] is a collection of books which you /haven't/ read.

They exist to remind us that there is so much important knowledge out
there, and that we are ignorant of almost all of it.

This list contains what I believe are the 10 most important books that
I have not read.

1. Venkatesh Rao, /Breaking Smart/
0. James Clear, /Atomic Habits/
2. Will Durant, /The Story of Philosophy/
3. Josheph Sugarman, /The Adweek Copywriting Handbook/
4. Lifespan, /David Sinclair/
5. Rene Girard, /Things Hidden Since The Foundation of the World/

6. SÃ¶nke Ahrens, /How To Take Smart Notes/
7. Vladimir Nabokov, /Lolita/
8. John Holt, /How Children Learn/ and /How Children Fail/
9. John Barton, /A History of the Bible/
