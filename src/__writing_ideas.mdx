title: Writing Ideas
description: Topics I want to explore
---

- The art vs product spectrum
- Useful but probably false ideas
  - The body is a recursive map of the world
- My explore-exploit heuristic
  - Do things only if you can justify doing them again for as long as you have already done them. If you have dated a girl for a year but can't see yourself dating her another full year, it's best to break up now than in 6 months.

## Quantified Improvement

- Quantified Improvement Philosophy
- Learning Emacs
- Learning to type on a 40% keyboard
- Learning Laptop Piano

## The Good Life

- Will's Summary of Life and How to Live it
- Progressive Overload Everything
- Focus on things that have built in judges - MMA sorts the bad martial arts from the good by actually fighting against each other
  - things that are unforgiving
  - things that you can't fake
  - pullups
- Creativity's relationship with unforgiving tasks
- communicating with an audience
- being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points (Kevin Kelly)
- Time is the only valuable resource, we can't save it, everything else is a proxy for that
- Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
- I'm afraid of writing

## Productivity and Technology

- Just use Vim dummy
