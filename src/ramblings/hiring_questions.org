This is a list of questions that I expect to be asked during job
interviews. My goal by compiling this list is to have well thought
through answers.  Not so that I can practice them and rehearse them
(although that is one benefit) but because these are important
questions not only for getting hired, but for life.

If someone cares enough about a question that they'd ask it in an
interview, it is probably an important question with insights into ones
character. I should spend time thinking about my answers.XS

It is broken down into two sections:

1. The questions that interviewees typically get asked.
2. Questions that I typically ask interviewers. These sections reflect
   the things I exepct and enjoy within a workplace.

## Interviewee Questions

- What is a struggle you have overcome?
- What is your greatest weakness?
- Tell me about a project you lead?
- Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity?


## Interviewer Questions

- In what ways is this position and company changing in the coming
  year?
- What can I do to 'win' at this job?
- If you were to leave this company, why?
- In what ways does this company directly foster growth?
