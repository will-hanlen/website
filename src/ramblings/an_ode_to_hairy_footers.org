* An Ode to Hairy Footers

A footer is the section at the bottom of a website.

A hairy footer is what I call a footer with lots of interesting and
useful links.

Interesting and useful enough to be on the site at all, but too
unrelated to be part of the main content.

Those are the links I really want.

The one-off, wacky links that don't fit with the rest of the blog.

A link to a list of books you recommend? Yes please.

A link subtly evangelizing good web design and selfdogfooding? I love it.

A link to your other projects? I will click.

A link explaining that your site was generated from within Org-mode?
Of course.

A link to a random meme that explains the bizzare title of your site?
Indeed.
