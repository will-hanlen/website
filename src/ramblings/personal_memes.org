* Personal Memes

I think there's a lot of value in thinking about your memes.

Here, I mean 'meme' not purely in the internety sense, but in the context of memetics.

What are the things you do or say which people copy?

Sometimes they are jokes or 'memeable' phrases like doge or SWAG.

But sometimes, memes are emotions.
You can transfer your joy, anger, sadness, or tranquility to others simply by being around them.

Sometimes memes are ideas.
You can spread a meme of an investment strategy, religious ideology, or mental model.

If someone copies it from you, it's a meme.

Even if you copied it from someone else.

I think it's important to spread positive memes and not negative memes.
Spread memes that make the world better.

For memes that I think make the world better, see [[md:/][my resources page]].
