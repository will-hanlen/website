This site is my summary of life, and how to live it.

It has two purposes:

## 1. Become a better thinker

Clear writing is clear thinking.
If you can't explain an idea clearly in writing, then you probably don't *actually* understand the idea.

I will be writing about ideas I think are important, in an attempt to force myself to understand them.

Although I hope you enjoy these essays, my main motive is a selfish pursuit of better thinking.

## 2. Codify a manual for living

I'm terrified of squandering the one life I have.
I refuse to get to my deathbed only to realize I cared about the wrong things.

With the decline of religiosity and community in the modern world, it's stupidly difficult to know what to care about.

I won't claim to know the secrets to a good life, but by writing these essays I will try to find them.

I want this body of knowledge to be complete enough that I could give it a kid and be confident that if taken to heart they will live a fulfilled life.

Of course, I will never know everything there is to know about life, so this project will never complete.
This means that every essay is a working document that will change as I change.
I plan to completely rewrite ideas years after originally publishing if I gain new insight.

## Guiding Principles

1. Anonymous

    I have no interst in gaining status from this site.
    Fame brings with it a depenence on the audience which I would like to avoid.
    
    The ideas here have nothing to do with me, and by adding my name to them I unnecissarily attach my ego.

2. Free

    Nothing here will ever cost money.
    All I ask for is your feedback if you think I'm wrong and accountability if I'm being lazy.

3. Concise

    Most internet essays can be summed up in a tweet.
    If all you want are the big ideas, I will begin each essay with a tweet length summary.

4. Grounded

    A philosophy is useless unless it can improve everyday life.
    The ideas written about here are how I actually try to live my life.

5. Transparent

    I won't hide when I'm wrong and have to update an essay.
    Many of my ideas are probably wrong, but unless I take the time to think them through and write them down, I'll never know.

    To get periodically notified when I change a big idea, write new drafts, or come across interesting ideas, subscribe to the [newsletter](/newsletter).
