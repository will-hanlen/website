  <h1>Learning to type 100 WPM</h1>
<p>I spend most of my productive time at a computer screen coding and writing.
I'm a decent typer but I want to be better than decent.
This is my journey of improving from 65 WPM to 100 WPM.</p>
<p>This experiment is all about speed, but it turns out that typing speed is suprisingly unimportant for productivity.
Typing 100 WPM is impressive but probably won't improve my ability to quickly edit documents too much.
This is because most of the time I spend editing documents I'm not just typing text in a straight line like you do when you practice typing -
I'm moving text around, navigating to different parts of the document, and making small edits in lots of different places.
So typing speed isn't the real bottleneck and typing 100 WPM won't make me significantly more productive.
If I really wanted to get faster at editing I should get better at Vim, actually RTFM, and stop checking my phone.</p>
<p>So why care about typing speed?
Honestly I don't really care about speed.
Learning to type faster is just a cool project for me with easily measurable results.
I've recently become  interested in quantified self, the strategy of tracking data about yourself to help you become your best self.
In Quantified Self you often run experiments on yourself (often using biometrics) to see what works best for you.
I'm interested in running skill improvement tests on myself to see what works best for me to increase my abilities.
These projects and experiments will range from physical fitness to learning quick mental arithmetic.
So long story short, this project for me is way more about practicing tracking data and getting into the habbit of using data to catalyze improvement.</p>
<h2>How I practice</h2>
<p>Train every day on an online typing game called typeracer.com and track progress.
I chose this site because it does all the data collection for me (lazy I know) as long as I pay them.
I will suplement the races with training on individual keys using goodtyping.com.
The goal is reached when I can type above 100WPM for 5 races in a row.
I initially plan to practice for about 30 mins per day.</p>
<h2>Initial Predictions</h2>
<p>Although I have no data to base this off, I predict I will reach my goal within 3 weeks.
I think improvement will be pretty linear.
I think consistency will be the limmiting factor, as long as I practice every day, the results will come.</p>
<h2>Thoughts throughout the process</h2>
