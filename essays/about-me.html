    About <br>
    Me
  </h1>

<p>
  I live in Colorado and
  I'm interested in computer science, calistenics, cooking, and creating things.
</p>

<p>
  I haven't yet made anything super interesting or notable,
  but this webpage will document me trying.
  I'll write about attempts to improve my skills and projects I'm working on.
