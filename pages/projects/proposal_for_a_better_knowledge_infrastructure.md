# Proposal for a better knowledge infrastructure


## Access to knowledge is essential for gaining autonomy

Access to knowledge breaks down percieved helplessness.

Prot starts by pointing out that without knowledge, we cannot grow. We
get trapped in our current paradigm, with no knowledge of higher
levels of thinking.

We think this is how things must be. We
fail to see any alternative, and thus have no ability to choose a
better narative.  We lose our autonomy.

Helplessness soon turns into closed-mindedness.

A diminished sense of helplessness leads to a responsibility to improve

A lack of knowledge leads to a lack of autonomy. Which leads to a lack
of discipline and responsibility. Which we then rationalize into a
victim mindset; as if things are supposed to be this way.

Responsibility begets discipline.

Discipline begets autonomy: rule over oneself.

Autonomy is a good goal.

Well worth the cost of achieving it.
Autonomy gives you power.
Power is a scary sounding word but it's not intrinsically morally good
or bad. The challenge is to integrate power with wisdom. My hope is
that if freedom begets power, knowledge begets wisdom.


## Challenge 1: Our knowledge systems are not self documenting

RTFM is great advice when the manual is well written and accessible.

Self documenting is when a system tells you what the paths are and tells you how to learn about those paths.

Simply knowing what your options are is a viable alternative to struggling

Self documenting is the ability to learn about your options at any
given moment from within the system.  Not only that, learn how to
learn more about those options.

Self documentation leads to tighter feedback loops.

You can quickly switch from learning to practicing.


## Solution 1: Knowledge Graphs

Every idea is atomic.

Zettlecasten.

Atomic ideas can be practiced

Anki

Atomic ideas can connect into graphs of knowledge.

Knowledge graphs are zoomable.

Progressive summarization.  The first sentence of every paragraph is a
summary of that paragraph. If you only want the high level ideas, your
knowledge graph reader can display only the first sentences seamlessly.
The ideas at that level are still coherant, just less in depth.

Plaintext nodes can be available in any system, forever.

The users get to decide how they want it styled.

Nodes can link to eachother like websites.


## Challenge 2: A single person is not enough

If I knew enough to write it all myself, I wouldn't have to write it.

The value is not only in the knowledge but also in the discourse about what knowledge to include.


## Solution 2: Open Sourcing

An open sourced knowledge source is fundamentally different from books

Many life manuals books have been written before.
Many self help blog posts have been written before.

They lack timelessness of a community engagement that open source
gives something.  Once published books and blogs stagnate, but an open
source book is a living, breathing collection of ideas.

Open sourced writing has the potential to be better simply because it
never has to be finished.  Many great minds can work for many more
hours than a single author, no matter how brilliant, could achieve.

Ideas can evolve transparently with version control

Written as literate programming, but instead of documenting the logic
of a program it documents the logic of an argument.

As the version control history grows, you can watch the philosophers
ideas branch and merge.

A community will grow around building this tree of knowlege.


## Challenge 3: A single community is not enough

There is no autonomy until you can make your own path

The ultimate goal is to allow for autonomy: rule of oneself.
Ultimately that looks like people coming up with their own ideas,
rules, and maxims.  Their own philosophy of life.  But the barrier to
entry to share those ideas and communicate them through this community
must not be high.  Anyone should be able to dissent. To have control
over what they believe to be the true nature of the universe.

Knowledge is necessary for autonomy but it is not sufficient.  Emacs
is not just self-documenting; it's also extensible and customizable.
We must be able to formulate our own ideas and have control over them

Consensus isn't a reasonable expectation for most important topics

The problem with the Wikipedia model is that there is only room for
one page on each topic.  This may be fine for a simple idea or
biography, but what about the idea of 'sin'?  Certainly different
people have different definitions of that word and would write vastly
different entries into the knowledge tree for it.  The power of
federating communities into a single platform is that a Babtist
federation can have it's own version of sin and a Jewish federation
can have it's own version of sin.

There must be space for dissent and fracturing

Multiple perspectives are imperative. The system must be
self-docuemtning and extensible. MAKE YOUR OWN OPTIONS.

Multiple communities are needed to allow for dissent, but a common platform is needed to prevent echochambering

The problem with having multiple communities is that those communities
become echochambers because they don't exist on a common platform.
They have their own sites online where they can't be disturbed.  And
for good reason, centralizing onto a single platform puts the immense
censorship power in the hands of those who control the platform.


## Solution 3: Federated Technologies

Federated technologies share a platform but without the need for a central authority

Anoyone can 'fork' a communitiy and start their own

Individuals should be held accountable to their community but not to the platform

Ideas should be from individuals but accountable to a community.
You get credit for what you wrote maybe but it's not about the
individual. This isn't Twitter where the point is to talk as
individuals, the point here is discourse as communities through the
power of federations.

A common platform can reduce echochambers and increase empathy

There could easily be settings implemented into a knowledge entry
which surfaces oposing opinions for a node.

Federated technologies can have multiple communities' ideas viewed on
the same platform but host on separate platforms to avoid control and
censorship.  This means a news community can have an entry for a news
event and so can MSNBC and FOX and my little brother and your dad.  As
long as you post into a federated branch you will not be censored.

Because everyone is posting onto the same node, different perspectives
can be cylced through as if flipping the pages of a book.

This deepens the transparancy of an ideology.  It demistifies it and
humanizes it.


## Challenge 4: Commentary is not enough

Why should I trust you?

Why should you trust me?

Pure commentary lacks a shared, grounded reality

If we can't agree what's real how can we can we talk.  This is the
purpose of culture: to provide a shared reality.  It's important that
cultural texts be available and linked within our comentaries.


## Solution 4: Primary Source Libraries

Integrating primary sources and knowledge directly creates more trust and discoverability

In emacs the most efficient way to learn something is to go to the
source of truth: the docs. Not a youtube video.
We need a shared truth to base our knowledge on. Classic texts and
primary sources are the foundation of knowledge.

Any public domain text can be added.

Primary sources will be hosted by communities, but not edited like nodes

They don't have atomicity and zooming.
Links to primary sources will be hash verified to ensure the shared
reality retains its integrity. Primary sources may also benefit from
being in version control.

Plaintext formats of primary sources make them protable, sharable, and available forever


## Challenge 5: Adoption and Standardization

Where does a knowledge tree start?

These ideas are well and good, but how do we actually make it? Reality
abhors the neatess and naiveness of this simple challenge -> solution
paradigm.

Protocall are hard to agree upon and standarize

Open source growth is not based on market incentives


## Solution 5: The Encyclosphere

The Encyclosphere is an idea from the Knowledge Standards Foundation

The standard aims to be adopted as the defacto knowledge format

Focusing on the community level gives immediate value.

All of a communitie's knowledge can be stored on this platform and
they will get value from it like a normal wiki, but without the
benefit of exposure and access to other federation's knowledge.

Universities can host (and maintain) their courses

You can then tell a student, read the manual, and then they can. But
the manual isn't like a textbook that is separated from all the other
knowledge. It's also not static like a text book, you can add to it.

Capitalistic incentives are not needed for collaboration

Progress may be slower, but the results can last significantly longer.


## Critiques

Doesn't google already make the internet self documenting and extensible enough?


## Other Ideas / Nodes


### Kegan's 5 Stages of Mental Complexity

Stage 1) Something from childhood

Stage 2) Being a kid

Stage 3) The socialized mind
We identify ourself with our group

Stage 4) The self-authoring mind
We identify ourselves as an individual capable of being separate
from the group

Stage 5) The self-transforming mind
We acknowledge contradictions and can have multiple,
interchangeable lenses of the world.

Most people naturally reach stage 3 by adulthood, However only 1% of
people get to Stage 5.

We can't progress through the stages without knowledge of the higher
stage.  In the transition from stage 3 to 4 we must gain the knowledge
of a belief that contradicts what our group believes - to distinguish
what we think from what our group thinks.  With that, we can pull
ourselves up to the 4th stage regularly.

In the transition from stage 4 to 5, we must gain knowlege of a
paradigm that validly contradicts our personal paradigm.  Then you
will more easily realize your potential to hold contradictions at the
same time and strengthen your ability to discern which paraigm lens to
wear at any given moment.


### Knowledge of Enlightenment

This connection between knowledge and autonomy also relates to the
Buddhist idea of enlightenment.  By enlightenment I mean mental states
which produce extreme detachment from suffering through concentration,
equanimity, and clarity.  It is another tool to improve control over
your own thoughts and emotions. To have autonomy over yourself.

Once we have been exposed to the knowledge of these enlightened
states, either through a breif taste or through someone else's
experience, then it's up to us to take responsisbility.  We must be
diligent, disciplined, and hard working in our pursuit of that
improved paradigm.

But without the knowledge, or even a taste, of those desireable mental
states, we will never strive for them.  We get stuck in the human
state of suffering and mental confusion.  We believe that our current,
worse, mental state is the only option.  We become OK with it. We
rationalize meditation as a silly religious practice, and even defend
our mental discontentedness.


### On success and failure

This is a total pipe dream. But if the idea is perfected I think it
could change how we as humans access knowledge. It is unlikely to
succeed. I know nothing yet of running an open source community of
knowledge nodes, but I believe it to be a worthy cause nonetheless.


### Interactive Essays

If this idea doesn't turn out to be transformative for others, at
least for me it provides a cool structured way to write interactive
essays. By interactive, I mean zoomable. An essay that isn't designed
to be read 'word for word' if all you want is the high-level overview.

This project must benefit me first (Scratch your own itch)


## TODOs


### Learn more about open source licenses

Learn about the rules for using other people's work. Is it possible
for a community to have a paid node, then allow it to still be referenced in
other nodes with progressive summarization for free?


### Does federated technology rely on blockchain

That sounds right but I'm pulling shit out my ass


### Learn more about the Knowledge Standards Foundation and Encyclosphere


### New Section: Am I trying to re-create the internet?


### Traversing time through a node tree?

How can we represent time in a node tree?
One way I think is to have a simple list of events, each linking to a root which
describes it.

This assumes that there is a way to sort nodes based on one of their propeties.
Every node in the tree has to have a date property, which can be used to sort
the timeline.

What does this idea look like for a personal diary? I like the idea of
progressive summarization within a diary. Allowing you to see a high level
overview of your past at every level of detail. Capsulate?


### Start with individuals, then move to communities, then globally

I believe that this idea has to be useful to a single individual.
Maybe as a personal knowledge management solution. If not, it will never
gain enough traction to be adopted widely.

If however, it is useful to a single person, it can easily be made shareable
with technologies like git that already exist. Then multiple people can
work within the same knowledge infrastructure. They can build upon eachother's
nodes.  This forms the basis of a community. They must regulate who can add
to nodes and how. What is the approval process. Once enough of these communities
popup, then they can be federated into a single global network of ideas.z


### Critiques from IndieWeb

There are a few things that IndieWeb has to say about projects like this.
They are probably right.
