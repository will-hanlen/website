How to enjoy the internet while providing value.

-   Treat online life the same way you treat real life.
    
    Everyone knows this one. The golden rule. Be nice. Blah blah blah.

-   Never share something you haven't read.
    
    Also, try not to have opinions on things you haven't read. Keep an
    open mind.

-   Make your writing easier to read than it was to write.
    
    If you don't put effort into making your ideas consumable, you're
    wasting peoples' time.

    Write things that interest YOU.
    
    Joke about things that make YOU laugh.
    
    Build things that YOU will use.

-   Innocent until proven guilty.
    
    The internet connects us to every idea.  Certainly some are bad, but
    don't waste this amazing access to information by simply confirming
    what you already know.
    
    Treat new, potentially uncomfortable ideas, as holding at least some
    truth until you have a reason disbelieve.
