# Quotes & Poems

Sometimes in life, it helps to have a few quotes memorized.  Something
about a good quote cuts past the fluff of language in a way that makes
the truth easier to find.

Once you have them memorized, you'll be suprised by just how often you
use them as little mental hooks to guide you in the right direction.

Here are some that I have found useful.

---

Annie Dillard on the preciousness of time:

> How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.

---

Socrates on getting ripped:

> No citizen has a right to be an
> amateur in the matter of physical
> training&#x2026; what a disgrace it is for a
> man to grow old without ever
> seeing the beauty and strength of
> which his body is capable.

---

John Stewart Mill on war:

> War is and ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things.
> The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling
> which thinks that nothing is worth war, is much worse&#x2026;
> The man who has nothing for which is willing to fight, nothing which is
> more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable
> creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept
> so by the exertions of better men than himself&#x2026;

---

> This too shall pass.

A French rhyme:

> Cet animal est très méchant:  
> Quand on l’attaque, il se défend.

[Translated](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1966/01/20/translation/) by Vladimir Nabokov into English as:

> This animal is very wicked:  
> Just see what happens if you kick it.

or

> This beast is very mean: in fact  
> It will fight back, when it’s attacked.
