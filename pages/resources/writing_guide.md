A compiled list of writing advice I've stolen from much better writers.

-   Write like you speak
-   Write short sentences
    -   Avoid dashes to break up sentences
    -   Avoid parenthetical thoughts
-   Never use a long word where a short one will do
-   Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent
-   If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out
-   Never use the passive where you can use the active
-   Write the first draft on paper
-   Avoid negating clauses
