# Posessions

I generally enjoy owning as few things as possible. There are some
philosophical reasons for this, but I'm a minimalist mostly because it
simply feels good to own less.

If done correctly, lack of quantity compells an increase in
quality. For example, if you only own one pair of shoes, it better be
a good one.

As a result of being quite particular about which items I allow myself
to own, I believe I have pretty good taste in material goods. (Bear in
mind that my friends, family, and every female on the planet
disagrees.)

This list only covers the things I think will be interesting to
others.
