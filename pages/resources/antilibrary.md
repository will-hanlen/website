# Antilibrary

An [antilibrary](https://fs.blog/2013/06/the-antilibrary/) is a collection of books which you haven't read.

They exist to remind us that there is so much important knowledge out
there, and that we are ignorant of almost all of it.

This list contains what I believe are the 10 most important books that
I have not read.

1.  Venkatesh Rao, *Breaking Smart*
2.  James Clear, *Atomic Habits*
3.  Will Durant, *The Story of Philosophy*
4.  Josheph Sugarman, *The Adweek Copywriting Handbook*
5.  Lifespan, *David Sinclair*
6.  Rene Girard, *Things Hidden Since The Foundation of the World*
    -   [Alex Danco's introduction to Girard which got me interested](https://alexdanco.com/2019/04/28/secrets-about-people-a-short-and-dangerous-introduction-to-rene-girard/comment-page-1/)
7.  SÃ¶nke Ahrens, *How To Take Smart Notes*
8.  Vladimir Nabokov, *Lolita*
9.  John Holt, *How Children Learn* and *How Children Fail*
10. John Barton, *A History of the Bible*
