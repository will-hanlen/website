## Poetry

William Earnest Henely, *Invictus*

> Out of the night that covers me,  
> Black as the pit from pole to pole,  
> I thank whatever gods may be  
> For my unconquerable soul.  
>
> In the fell clutch of circumstance  
> I have not winced nor cried aloud.   
> Under the bludgeonings of chance  
> My head is bloody, but unbowed.  
>
> Beyond this place of wrath and tears  
> Looms but the Horor of the shade,  
> And yet the menace of the years  
> Finds and shall find me unafraid.  
>
> It matters not how strait the gate,  
> How charged with punishments the scroll,  
> I am the master of my fate,  
> I am the captian of my soul.  

> This beast is very mean: in fact  
> It will fight back, when it's attacked.  
>
> Vladimir Nabokov
