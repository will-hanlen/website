Spirituality has two functions:

1.  Be a part of something bigger than ourselves. To recogonize the limits of our weak human minds and bodies. To surender to a higher power.
2.  To give purpose to our lives.

Here is my version of Spirituality.

I am a collection of atoms, tightly configured in a way that results in self-awareness.
The length of time for which I will live is truly insignificant compared to the age of the universe.
The number of atoms I consist of is truly insignificant compared to the size of the universe.
My mind, a function of the interactions between these atoms, evolved to survive in a specific environment that I no longer have access to.

I cannot comprehend the complex chain of cause and effect that created me, let alone understand the entirity of the universe.

When I die, my atoms will disperse back to the dirt from which they came.
My memories, desires, and dreams will go with them.

Any purpose I followed will fade because, with time, humanity itself will die and everything that we fought so fiercely for will disapear.

I am insignificant.
And I have no purpose.

I am a part of something bigger than myself.
Something so big in fact that it doesn't even know I exist.
If the universe is capable of caring, I am too small for it to care whether I live or die.

So why am I not depressed?
How can I bear to live in a world where nothing matters?

Well, because it feels good.

Living feels good.
Even though I know rationally that nothing matters, things still matter to me because they just do.

I can give myself purpose knowing fully that it's constructed in my own mind.

What purpose have I given myself?

****To simply enjoy a fulfilling life and help others do the same.****

How do I do that?

Step 1: Look to prehistory to know what's really important

The things that make us fulfilled are directly derived from the things that kept us alive 200,000 years ago.
This is because our brain evolved to reward us when we do things that are correlated with surival - at least the version of survival that was relavent 200,000 years ago.

This means that things like being in nature are intrinsically fulfilling.

Being physically strong and mentally sharp too.

The same with having close relationships.
We need people who we can depend upon because our survival was rooted in teamwork with our tribe.

Step 2: Find that in the modern world

I doubt anyone reading this essay lives in a hunter-gatherer tribe on the African plains.
We live in dimly lit apartments miles from anything remotely resembling the natural world.

The way we interact with society has changed, our economies have changed, and our technology has changed.

Even though the things that truly fulfill us are the same as 200,000 years ago, the route to get them is different.

This means we have to find alternative challenges to overcome and different ways to fill those ancient holes in our souls.

Step 3: Think longterm

When considering my life's purpose of: enjoying a fulfilling life and helping others do the same, it's easy to misunderstand that.

You might picture me enjoying ice cream and lounging around.
Or driving fast cars and having sex with beautiful women.

Although those things sound great, I suspect they won't lead to a truly fulfilling life.

Counterintuitvely, the things that do lead to a fulfilling life are discipline and overcoming challenges.
Hard lives are more fulfilling than easy ones, if navigated well.

&#x2014;

So in life I wander around, fulfilling the desires given to me by evolution and being in awe of the vastness of the world around me.
This makes me part of something bigger than myself and&#x2026;
