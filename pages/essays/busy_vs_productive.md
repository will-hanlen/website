# Busy vs Productive

I have a tendency to do a lot of 'work' but not actually
get a lot done.  For example, I've spent more time in the last six
months meticulously writing CSS styling for this site than acutally
writing essays.

This essay is a collection of productivity principles that I want to
employ to stop being busy and start being generative.  Of course, I am
not perfect and often falter when implementing these.


## Framework: Vision, Goals, and Systems

Without an overall vision, effort is wasted.  It doesn't matter how
productive you are if you are productively moving in the wrong
direction.

Productivity is a tool to get stuff done, but it doesn't help us
decide whether something should be done.  This is what a vision is
for.

> There is nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency
something which should not be done at all. - Peter Drucker

A vision should be as long term as you can vividly imaging and should
be grand in it's scope.  Connect that vision to a purpose that gives
your life meaning and fulfillment.  Having a strong purpose will give
you a reason to do the things that unsuccessful wont.

Goals are the stepping stones that make your grand, fuzzy vision
tangible.  They must be grounded in reality and clear.

I like to use 13 week segments for goal setting because 13 neatly
divides the 52 weeks of the year into 4 season.  13 weeks is long enough
to get a substantial amount of work done but short enough that you
don't lose focus.

I've found it help to give a theme to each 13 week segment which ties
all your effort into a single motiviting idea.

Systems provide the steps that turn your goals into actions.  Without
systems, your goals are simply dreams. Systems include your habits,
social accountability, and task management.

A core component of any system should be exercise and sleep; both
of which boost focus and productivity in all other areas.

This framework of vision, goals, and systems ties everything you do
together. Every task and habit in your system supports progress on a
goal which furthers progress towards the vision of what you want your
life to be.


## Set outcomes, not implementation

When goal setting, don't worry about how something gets done; worry
about whether that thing should be done at all and when it should be
done by.

Have a clear idea of what the end-state of what accomplishing that
goal looks like.

Without clear end-states, it's hard to prioritize which sub-tasks are
the most important.

Goals should always have an end date.  Discomfort is always more
bearable when we know when it will end.


## Implement effort, not outcomes

When translating your clear end-state goals into daily and weekly
tasks, it helps to focus on effort instead of outcomes.

This is because the more creative a task, the less you can plan it out.

You rarely know what an essay is about before you start writing it.
Writing, and I believe most creative processes, are iterative and
explorative.

"Write for 25 minutes" is a better task than "Write essay
about productivity."

Effort should be focussed for brief discrete time periods.  Discomfort
is always more bearable when we know when it will end.  Pomodoros work
well because of this.

With consistent effort, and a clear end-state, progress mostly takes
care of itself.


## One task at a time

Multitasking is impossible.  The more of my focus I can put
into a single idea, the better.

This works on the micro and macro level.

On the micro level, don't try to do multiple tasks at a time. Have
systems in place that ensure your working process is as linear as
possible.  If that means taking twice as long to plan something out,
so be it; at least it will actually get done.

On the macro level, don't have too many plates spinning in life at
once.  Choose one topic at a time and really throw yoursef into it
instead of dabling in multiple areas at once.


## Think in MVP

Don't get stuck in unimportant details.  Don't spend six months on the
CSS of your blog.

It's not that CSS is not important, it's just that it's way less
important.

You can always go back and iterate on the CSS in the future.  Get an
MVP working and move on.
