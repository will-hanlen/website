# Tool Traps

Sometimes, the most dangerous risks to my productivity are my own tools.

As a programmer, the trap started when I learned about Vim.
I started learning to do my budget, meal planning, and image editing in plaintext.

Next, I installed Linux and a tiling window manager to get away from the mouse-based nonsense regular people use.
I threw out my Python codebases and did everything in C.

I made a standing desk and got two plants in white porcelain pots.
The RGB colors on my custom mechanical keyboard synced perfectly with my room's ambient lighting.
Emacs lurked just around the corner and started whispering beautiful ELisp in my ear.

Welcome to tool hell.
If you're like me you've been here before.
It's a place where you'll never be productive again because instead of doing real work, you write config files to manipulate the program you think you will eventually do work in.
You might even publish your config files thinking you are creating something valuable.
Hours and hours are spent planning the perfect workflow instead of actually having a workflow.

It's a serious problem, and not just for programmers.
Aspiring musicians obsess over the perfect guitar picks and microphone stands.
Would-be chefs spend more time researching knives, buying them, and sharpening them, than actually cooking with them.

We fall into this trap because tools are cool, but the truth is, **tools just aren't as important as we think they are.**
A 1,000 line Emacs config file and a 40% mechanical keyboard may be the most efficient programming setup in the world, but it has little impact on your ability to write quality programs.
A high-end, hand-crafted guitar may produce the perfect sound, but has little to do with your ability to compose good music.
The camera on your smartphone is better than any camera that existed in 1940 but that doesn't mean your cinematography rivals that of Casablanca.
Tools and craft are separate.

**It's easy to improve your tools but it's hard to improve your craft**, yet we often think when we upgrade our tools we upgrade our craft.
This is a fallacy.
If you suck at painting, a better easel won't fix it.
Painting more will.

Tools exist for a reason, but they can trap you into thinking that better tools lead to better results.
To get out of this trap you must separate thinking about tools from thinking about craft - then devote way more energy to craft than to tools.
Improving your tools is still valuable, but ensure you care about your craft before caring about your tools.
