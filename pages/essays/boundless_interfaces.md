# Boundless Interfaces

This is an essay about a mental model I call 'boundless interfaces.'
The central idea comes from thinking about the different types of thoughts that are possible and thinking about what things control those types of thoughts.


## What are the different types of thoughts?

Not all thoughts are verbal.
Some thoughts are auditory, but not verbal.
Some thoughts are just visual.
Every sense in your body has its own kind of thought it produces.

Algorithms are a type of thought.
Math is a kind of thinking about numbers.
Emotions are a kind of thought.


## How do we interact with different kinds of thoughts?

We create, modify, and communicate thoughts through interfaces.

Different thought types have different interfaces.
Verbal thought types are interfaced by writing.
Thoughts about money are interfaced by budgets.
Thoughts about things we can see are interfaced by pictures and paintings.
Thoughts about time are interfaced by calendars.


## How do we create new kinds of thoughts?

We create new kinds of though when we create interfaces to control other interfaces.

For example, a phone app is an interface to a specific kind of thinking that is held in the business logic of that app.
The app implements that logic by controlling lower-level interfaces such as the graphics library that displays words on the screen.
Those interfaces are controlling the flow of binary bits at the hardware level.

Because of the abstraction from 1s and 0s up to application logic, the app can create a kind of thought which may not have been possible before.

Cryptocurrencies are a kind of thought which was not possible before
 blockchain.
Blockchain was not possible before software.

'Little Wing' by Jimi Hendrix is a kind of musical thought which was
not possible before electric guitars.
Electric guitars were not possible before electrical outlets.

The most important interface innovations not only smartly build upon other interfaces, but allow future innovations to be built upon them.


## How do interfaces work?

Every interface has a 'vocabulary.'
The vocabulary is how you manipulate the interface.
In human language, that vocabulary is words.

The vocabulary of mathematics is numbers and equations.
The vocabulary of music is notes and chords.
The vocabulary of a piece of software is its API.

By learning the vocabulary of an interface, you learn how to create and communicate that kind of thought.


## What makes an interface powerful?

I believe powerful interfaces:

-   Have a large vocabulary
-   Can extend their own vocabulary
-   Will exist long into the future
-   Play well with other interfaces

I call interfaces that have all four of these qualities 'boundless interfaces.'

Here are some examples of boundless interfaces.

Guitars have a nearly unlimited vocabulary of sounds they can produce.
You can modify a guitar by tuning it differently or playing it differently to create new, unheard musical thoughts.
Guitars will certainly exist in 10 years and if you care about musical thoughts, it will be worth your effort to learn.
Guitars can be put into any song with other instruments and sound good.

Elisp is a Turing Complete programming language which has an unlimited number of things it can do.
You can modify the syntax of Elisp if you wanted to, using Elisp.
For as long as Emacs exists, Elisp will exist.
Hopefully forever.
Elisp has a powerful API and can play well with other software systems.


## Why should you seek boundless interfaces?

An interface cannot create a thought more complex than the complexity of its vocabulary.
That means to have complex, powerful thoughts, you need complex, powerful interfaces.
Complex problems require powerful interfaces.

Interfaces are essentially access to a whole new type of thinking, and boundless interfaces simply provide more powerful thoughts.
Your mind's thoughts are limited to the vocabulary which you possess.

You make yourself smarter by learning how to control new kinds of thoughts.

In the book 1984, the evil state government tries to limit the verbal vocabulary of its citizens so that they could not think new thoughts.
Unless you focus on learning new interfaces, you are essentially doing the same thing to yourself.

Any time you are trying to create something novel or gain mastery over
a new kind of thought, seek boundless interfaces.


## When are boundless interfaces bad?

Not all problems require a complex interface.
In fact, most interfaces that we interact with in normal life do not need to be boundless at all.

Interacting with your kitchen stove should be done through a simple interface.
Unless you are a professional chef, your stove's interface does not need a large vocabulary.
You certainly don't need to be able to modify your stove's vocabulary.
Adjusting the heat is good enough.

There is value in simplicity when simplicity does the job well.
Don't over-complicate things.


## Interfacing internal thoughts

At the start of this essay, I said that emotions are a kind of thought.
But what is the interface to an emotion?

To answer this, I think we must distinguish between what I call internal and external thought types.

External thoughts are those which can be communicated directly to others.

Internal thoughts are those which can never exist outside the walls of your skull.

For example, anger can only be felt individually.
I cannot share my anger directly with you without first converting it to an external thought like writing or music.
The anger exists exclusively within my mind and when I stop experiencing the anger, it disappears.
Writing on a page however, still exists when someone stops reading it, and multiple people can read it to understand the same thought.

So what does an interface to an internal thought look like?

I think they tend to be actions or things which affect your physical body.

Romance, MDMA, and metta are interfaces to love.
Breath-work and diet are interfaces to calmness.

I would like to believe it's possible to innovate on internal thoughts in the same way we do external thought.

For example, you could combine MDMA, metta, and a romantic
relationship to induce a new kind of love thought.

I suspect it's much harder because we have to do more of the work ourselves instead of building on interfaces others have created.

I'm interested in exploring this idea more.
Specifically, how to use external thoughts as an explicit interface to internal thoughts or vice versa.
